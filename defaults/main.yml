# Fail2ban has a quit extensive configuration. Therefore you can simply copy
# arbitrary files to the target host.
# 
# Important: The files on the target host will be overwritten if they already exist.
# In addition you can use Jinja2 syntax in the config files because every file
# is handled by Ansible template module.
